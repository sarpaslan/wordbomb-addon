# Getting Started

Before you can run an addon, you need to install some software on your computer.

**Tips:**
- Just copy and paste the commands to terminal, no need to memorize anything
- Using AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help you is totally fine
- If something doesn't work, ask for help on our Discord

## Step 1: Download Node.js

1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Click "Download Node.js"
3. Select the latest version
4. Open the downloaded file
5. Click Next until it's done

## Step 2: Check if it Worked

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)
   - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, press Enter
2. Type this and press Enter:
```
node --version
```
3. If you see a number like `v25.2.1`, you're good!
